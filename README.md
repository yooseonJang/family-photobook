# family-photobook

This personal project was inspired by my mom wanting to create a family photobook of some sort since my siblings and I are growing uptoo fast lol. I will not be publishing any photos of my family for obious privacy reasons but I plan to work more on the graphics and user interface side of things for this project. Currently, I've only gotten to just positions of where I want things to be; I haven't figured out how I want graphics to be. The colouring you see are just placeholders so that I could adjust the position with rlative easiness. 

To finishing the project this summer ðŸ¥‚!

Here is the link to my work as of now:
