# family-photobook

This personal project was inspired by my mom wanting to create a family photobook of some sort since me and my brothers are growing up too fast lol. I will not be publishing any photos of my family for obvious privacy reasons but I plan to work more on the graphics and user interface side of things for this project. Currently, I've only gotten to just positioning elements of the first page; I haven't figured out how I want the graphics to be. The colouring you see are just placeholders so that I could adjust the position with relative easiness. 

Cheers to finishing the project this summer ðŸ¥‚!
